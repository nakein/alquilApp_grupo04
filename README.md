# AlquilApp application (Software engineering class)

  Summary: Obtain information of the idea of the clients and develop what they want. They published the following:

> Hello! We are two friends who work together in a dealership and we are interested in carrying out an idea that we have been chatting about for a while. We think it has great potential, but we don't really know where to start.
>
> To summarize, it is an application that we want to call Alquilapp (Rentapp) and it should allow people to rent a car for a certain period of time. The cars to rent should not be withdrawn from a fixed point, but rather they will be distributed throughout the city of La Plata (urban area).

## First project stage

- Client contact to know their needs

  We had to arrange a meeting with the client to obtain information about the idea. We made the necessary questions for the 30 minutes interview, and there, wrote the answers. This was made 2 times. In addition to this, we made a questionnaire to give it to random people, to obtain more information.

- Document all information obtained and other project features

  With the information obtained, we did the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** and the **Software Project Management Plan (SPMP/PGP in spanish)**

- Make a to-do list and estimate time

  Using pivotal tracker, we made the user stories (with the format As [role] i want to [action] so that [benefit]) and select the one who was the most difficult and the one who was the most easy to do. For this, we used the fibonacci point scale (0,1,2,3,5,8).

## Second project stage

- Develop the sistem in parts

To do this, we used the agile methodology **scrum** and the framework used was ruby on rails. We did 3 sprints of 2 weeks long, and each member of the team (3) was scrum master once.

- Show the parts to the client and get feedback

  We had 3 demos, and the client asked for add more features and change things. The scrum master at that time was in charge of show the work done.

- Analyze the final product
